        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>
            Porridge is a food made by heating or boiling ground, crushed or chopped starchy
            plants, typically grain, in milk or water. It is often cooked or served with added
            flavourings such as sugar, honey, (dried) fruit or syrup to make a sweet cereal, 
            or it can be mixed with spices, meat or vegetables to make a savoury dish. It is 
            usually served hot in a bowl, depending on its consistency.
