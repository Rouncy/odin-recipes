        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>2 x eggs</li>
            <li>15ml milk</li>
            <li>pinch of salt</li>
            <li>pinch of pepper</li>
            <li>1/2 table spoon of butter</li>

            Method
        </h2>
        <ol class="method">
            <li>Crack 2 eggs into a bowl, 
                add 15ml (1 tbsp) of milk and a pinch of salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Beat the mixture lightly with a whisk or fork.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tbsp of butter in a medium size fry pan on a low heat and 
                when it starts foaming, pour in the eggs and leave to set for 60-90 seconds.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula, gently pull the eggs from the edges of the pan into the centre. 
                Turn and tilt the pan so the runny eggs take up the available space and again
                gently pull it towards the centre. This gentle pulling towards the centre of the 
                pan makes lovely, light ribbons of egg.</li>
            <li>Remove the pan from the heat before the egg is completely set. 
                Leave to sit for a minute or two so the egg can gently finish cooking in its own 
                heat.</li>
        </ol>
